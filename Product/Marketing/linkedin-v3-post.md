Product Org OS v3 just shipped. Here's why it matters.

When I released v2, the idea was simple: give product teams an AI-powered operating system with agents, skills, and organizational memory. It worked, but the agents operated in isolation. They couldn't touch your actual tools.

v3 changes that. The headline: Connected Intelligence.

What's new:

- Agents auto-detect your connected tools. Jira, Slack, GitHub, Notion. Graceful fallback if a tool isn't there.

- 9 knowledge packs give agents real frameworks. Prioritization, pricing, competitive analysis, GTM playbooks. Not generic AI.

- Extension Teams: 26 specialists across Design, Architecture, and Marketing. Your PM can pull in a Security Architect mid-task.

- Agents respond like colleagues, not report generators. First person, concise, no fabricated projections.

39 agents. 61 skills. 8 gateways. Cross-platform (Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, Gemini CLI). All open source.

After 17 years building product orgs at NICE and Cognyte, I keep coming back to the same insight: product leadership is a system design problem. v3 makes that system smarter and more connected.
