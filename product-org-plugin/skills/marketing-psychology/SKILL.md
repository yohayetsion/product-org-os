## Foundational Thinking Models

### First Principles
Break problems down to fundamental truths, then build up. Don't accept "that's how it's done."

**Application:** Question industry pricing norms. What does it actually cost to deliver value?

### Jobs to Be Done
People don't buy products—they hire them to do a job. Understand the progress they're trying to make.

**Application:** "What job is the customer hiring this product for?" shapes all messaging.

### Inversion
Instead of asking "how do I succeed," ask "how could I fail?" Then avoid those paths.

**Application:** List all reasons a customer wouldn't buy. Address each one.

### Circle of Competence
Know what you know, and what you don't. Stay within your zone or expand deliberately.

**Application:** Only claim expertise you actually have. Customers sense overreach.

---

## Understanding Buyers

### Attribution Errors
We overattribute others' behavior to personality, underattribute to situation. Customers who churn may face situational pressures, not product hatred.

### Availability Heuristic
What comes to mind easily seems more common/important. Recent negative experience = outsized weight.

**Application:** Ensure positive touchpoints are recent and memorable.

### Confirmation Bias
People seek information confirming existing beliefs, ignore contradicting evidence.

**Application:** Align messaging with what prospects already believe, then expand.

### Dunning-Kruger Effect
Beginners overestimate their ability; experts underestimate. New customers may not realize they need help.

**Application:** Proactive onboarding for "confident" new users.

### Loss Aversion
Losses feel ~2x more painful than equivalent gains feel good.

**Application:** Frame as "don't lose X" rather than "gain X" when appropriate.

---

## Influencing Behavior

### Reciprocity
People feel obligated to return favors. Give value first without asking.

**Application:** Free tools, guides, templates → eventual purchase.

### Commitment & Consistency
Once someone takes a small action, they're more likely to take larger consistent actions.

**Application:** Small opt-ins → larger commitments. "Just try it for a week."

### Social Proof
People look to others' actions to determine their own, especially in uncertainty.

**Application:** Reviews, testimonials, "X customers use this," real-time activity.

### Authority
People follow credible experts and authoritative sources.

**Application:** Certifications, expert endorsements, thought leadership content.

### Scarcity
Limited availability increases perceived value.

**Application:** "Only X spots," "Offer ends," limited editions. Use honestly.

### Liking
People buy from those they like. Similarity, compliments, cooperation increase liking.

**Application:** Show the humans behind the brand. Find common ground.

---

## Pricing Psychology

### Anchoring
First price seen becomes the reference point. All other prices are judged relative to it.

**Application:** Show higher tier first. Original price → discounted price.

### Charm Pricing
$9.99 feels significantly less than $10.00 due to left-digit bias.

**Application:** Use for consumer products. Avoid for premium positioning.

### Price Relativity
Prices are evaluated in context, not absolute terms. Middle option often chosen.

**Application:** Three-tier pricing. Make middle tier the obvious choice.

### Mental Accounting
People categorize money into mental buckets with different spending rules.

**Application:** "Less than a coffee a day" reframes expensive as cheap.

---

## Design & Delivery

### Hick's Law
Decision time increases with number of options. Too many choices = no choice.

**Application:** Limit options. Progressive disclosure. Clear default.

### Friction/Effort
Every step, field, click is a potential drop-off point.

**Application:** Ruthlessly eliminate friction. Measure form abandonment.

### Peak-End Rule
Experiences are remembered by their peak moment and how they ended.

**Application:** Design memorable peaks. End on a high note.

### AIDA Model
Attention → Interest → Desire → Action. Classic funnel for messaging.

**Application:** Ensure each stage is addressed in landing pages.

### BJ Fogg Behavior Model
Behavior = Motivation × Ability × Prompt. All three needed simultaneously.

**Application:** Check: Is motivation high? Is it easy? Is there a clear trigger?

---

## Growth & Scaling

### Feedback Loops
Actions create consequences that influence future actions. Can be positive or negative.

**Application:** Build viral loops. Customer success → referral → more success.

### Compounding
Small consistent gains multiply dramatically over time.

**Application:** Focus on retention. 5% weekly growth compounds to 12x/year.

### Network Effects
Product becomes more valuable as more people use it.

**Application:** Features that benefit from user base growth.

### Flywheels
Self-reinforcing cycles that build momentum.

**Application:** Great content → SEO traffic → customers → testimonials → more content.

## Ethical Guidelines

Apply these principles to help customers make better decisions, not to manipulate.

**DO:**
- Use scarcity honestly (real limits)
- Build trust through genuine social proof
- Reduce friction for wanted actions

**DON'T:**
- Create fake urgency
- Manufacture social proof
- Hide important information
- Exploit cognitive biases against customer interest
