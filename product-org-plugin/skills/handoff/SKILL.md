Capture and transfer **session context** when delegating work from one agent to another.

## V2V Phase

**Cross-phase** - Handoffs enable delegation between agents at any phase.

**Prerequisites**: Work to delegate identified, receiving agent determined
**Outputs used by**: Receiving agent's context for continued work

## Purpose

When a senior agent (e.g., CPO) delegates work to another agent (e.g., Director PM), critical context can be lost. The handoff skill captures the current session context and creates a briefing document for the receiving agent.

## When to Use

Invoke `/handoff` when:
- CPO is delegating strategic work to a Director
- Director is assigning specific deliverables to a Manager
- Any agent needs to pass work to another with context
- Complex work requires preserving decisions and constraints

## Process

### 1. Identify Delegation

Determine:
- **Delegating agent**: Who is handing off (current agent)
- **Receiving agent**: Who will do the work
- **Task**: What needs to be done

### 2. Gather Session Context

Review the current conversation to extract:

#### Active Strategic Context
- Which strategic bet does this support?
- What portfolio priorities apply?

#### Relevant Decisions
- What decisions have been made that constrain this work?
- What was the rationale?

#### Constraints
- Timeline requirements
- Resource limitations
- Technical constraints
- Dependencies on other work

#### Key Assumptions
- What assumptions from strategic bets apply?
- What must remain true for this work to succeed?

#### Discussion Summary
- Key points discussed in this session
- Alternatives considered and rejected
- Stakeholder input received

### 3. Check Context Registry

Query the context registry for additional relevant context:
- `/context-recall` for the task topic
- Recent decisions that may apply
- Active assumptions in the area

### 4. Generate Handoff Document

Write to `context/handoffs/current-session.md`:

```markdown
# Session Context Handoff

*Generated: [Date and Time]*

## Delegation

**From**: @[delegating-agent]
**To**: @[receiving-agent]
**Task**: [Clear description of what needs to be done]

## Strategic Context

### Active Strategic Bet
**[SB-ID]: [Bet Title]**
- Status: [Status]
- Key thesis: [What we're betting on]
- This task's role: [How this work supports the bet]

### Portfolio Priority
[Where this fits in overall priorities]

## Relevant Decisions

### [DR-ID]: [Decision Title]
- **Status**: [Accepted/Proposed]
- **Key constraint**: [What this means for the current task]
- **Rationale**: [Why this was decided]

[Repeat for each relevant decision]

## Constraints

### Timeline
- [Timeline constraint 1]
- [Timeline constraint 2]

### Resources
- [Resource constraint 1]
- [Resource constraint 2]

### Technical
- [Technical constraint 1]

### Dependencies
- [Dependency 1] — Status: [Blocked/On track]
- [Dependency 2] — Status: [Blocked/On track]

## Assumptions to Preserve

| ID | Assumption | Status | Implication |
|----|------------|--------|-------------|
| [A-NNN] | [Assumption text] | [Status] | [What this means for the task] |

## Prior Discussion Summary

### Key Points
- [Point 1]
- [Point 2]
- [Point 3]

### Alternatives Considered
- [Alternative 1] — Rejected because: [Reason]
- [Alternative 2] — Rejected because: [Reason]

### Stakeholder Input
- [Stakeholder]: [Their input]

## Expected Deliverable

**What**: [Specific deliverable expected]
**Format**: [PRD / Roadmap / Analysis / etc.]
**Key requirements**:
- [Requirement 1]
- [Requirement 2]

**Success criteria**:
- [Criterion 1]
- [Criterion 2]

## Handoff Notes

[Any additional context the receiving agent should know]

---

*This handoff was generated by @[delegating-agent]. The receiving agent (@[receiving-agent]) should read this document before starting work.*
```

### 5. Instruct on Usage

Tell the user how to use the handoff:
```
Handoff document created at context/handoffs/current-session.md

To delegate to @[receiving-agent], start a new conversation with:
"@[receiving-agent] Please read @context/handoffs/current-session.md and then [task description]"

The receiving agent will inherit all context from this session.
```

## Instructions

1. Ask for receiving agent and task if not provided
2. Review current conversation for all relevant context
3. Query context registry for related decisions/assumptions
4. Generate comprehensive handoff document
5. Save to `context/handoffs/current-session.md`
6. Provide instructions for using the handoff

## Notes

- The handoff file is overwritten each time (one active handoff)
- For complex delegations, consider creating a persistent briefing document
- The receiving agent should acknowledge reading the handoff before proceeding
