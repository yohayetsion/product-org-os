description: Initialize the Product Org plugin - creates context folders and index files
argument-hint: (no arguments needed)
---

Initialize the **Product Org Plugin** for first-time use. This creates the context folder structure and all necessary index files in your current working directory.

## V2V Phase

**Cross-phase** - Setup is a prerequisite for all V2V work. Run once per project.

**Prerequisites**: None (this is the starting point)
**Outputs used by**: All skills that use the context layer

## What Gets Created

```

```

## When to Run

Run `/setup` once when you first install the plugin in a new project. The skill is idempotent - it won't overwrite existing files.

## Process

### 1. Check Current Directory

Confirm the user's working directory is where they want the context layer created.

### 2. Create Directory Structure

Create all required folders:
- `context/`
- `context/decisions/`
- `context/bets/`
- `context/assumptions/`
- `context/portfolio/`
- `context/learnings/`
- `context/handoffs/`
- `context/feedback/`
- `context/documents/`

### 3. Create Index Files

Create each index file with its initial template (only if it doesn't already exist):

#### context/README.md
```markdown
# Context Layer

The Context Layer provides **persistent memory** for your AI product organization. It enables decisions to be remembered, agents to share context, and the organization to learn from outcomes.

## Quick Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/context-save` | Save decision, bet, or learning |
| `/context-recall [topic]` | Query past decisions/context |
| `/portfolio-status` | View current strategic bets |
| `/handoff` | Capture context for delegation |
| `/relevant-learnings [topic]` | Find applicable past learnings |
| `/feedback-capture` | Capture and analyze feedback |
| `/feedback-recall [topic]` | Query past feedback |

## Folder Structure

- `decisions/` - Decision records with rationale
- `bets/` - Strategic bets with assumptions
- `assumptions/` - Tracked assumptions for validation
- `portfolio/` - Current active portfolio state
- `learnings/` - Accumulated organizational wisdom
- `handoffs/` - Agent-to-agent context passing
- `feedback/` - Customer and market feedback
- `documents/` - Registry of all strategic documents

## How It Works

1. After decisions/bets: `/context-save` extracts to registry
2. Before new work: `/context-recall` finds related context
3. For delegation: `/handoff` briefs receiving agent
4. For feedback: `/feedback-capture` documents with analysis
5. After outcomes: Reviews update assumptions and extract learnings

#### context/documents/registry.md
```markdown
# Document Registry

*Last updated: —*

The Document Registry tracks all strategic documents created by skills. This enables Document Intelligence - skills can find and update existing documents rather than always creating new ones.

## All Documents

| ID | Type | Title | Path | Status | V2V Phase | Related | Updated |
|----|------|-------|------|--------|-----------|---------|---------|
| — | No documents registered yet | — | — | — | — | — | — |

## By Type

### Requirements (PRDs, Specs, Stories)
*No documents yet*

### Strategy (Intent, Bets, Decisions)
*No documents yet*

### Roadmap (Themes, Items)
*No documents yet*

### GTM (Strategy, Launch Plans, Campaigns)
*No documents yet*

### Business (Cases, Pricing, Analysis)
*No documents yet*

### Operational (Playbooks, Reports, Scorecards)
*No documents yet*

### Learning (Reviews, Retrospectives)
*No documents yet*

## By Status

### Active
*Documents currently in use*

### Draft
*Work in progress*

### Archived
*Historical documents*

## Registered Directories

*Directories containing strategic documents (searched when finding documents)*

| Directory | Contains | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| — | No directories registered yet | — |

---

## How It Works

1. **When skills create documents**: They register here with ID, type, path
2. **When skills update documents**: They search here first by type/topic
3. **When skills find documents**: They list matching entries from this registry

### Document ID Conventions

| Type | Format | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| PRD | `PRD-[YYYY]-[NNN]` | PRD-2026-001 |
| Decision | `DR-[YYYY]-[NNN]` | DR-2026-015 |
| Strategic Bet | `SB-[YYYY]-[NNN]` | SB-2026-003 |
| Roadmap Theme | `RT-[YYYY]-[NNN]` | RT-2026-002 |
| Launch Plan | `LP-[YYYY]-[NNN]` | LP-2026-001 |

Skills auto-generate IDs when creating documents.
```

### 4. Create ROI Tracking Structure

Create ROI tracking folders and files:
- `context/roi/session-log.md`
- `context/roi/history/README.md`

### 5. Create JSON Index

Create `context/index.json` for fast topic-based retrieval:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "lastUpdated": "[current date]",
  "entries": [],
  "topicIndex": {},
  "typeIndex": {},
  "phaseIndex": {}
}
```

### 6. First-Run Welcome

Display welcome message with exploration guidance:

```markdown
# Welcome to Product Org OS!

Your AI-powered product organization is ready.

---

## Explore with Demo Content

This plugin includes **demo content** so you can see how everything works:

| Demo Content | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| 3 decisions | Pricing, API versioning, mobile-first |
| 2 strategic bets | Enterprise tier, self-serve growth |
| 7 feedback entries | Customer interviews, support, sales |
| 1 PRD | Dashboard redesign |

**Try these commands:**
```
/context-recall pricing        → See pricing-related decisions
/context-recall enterprise     → See enterprise strategy context
/portfolio-status              → View active strategic bets
/feedback-recall onboarding    → See onboarding feedback patterns
```

---

## Meet Your Team

Invoke agents for their perspective:

| Agent | Focus | Try |
|-------|-------|-----|
| `@pm` | Requirements, delivery | `@pm review the dashboard PRD` |
| `@vp-product` | Strategy, portfolio | `@vp-product our enterprise strategy` |
| `@plt` | Leadership decisions | `@plt should we prioritize enterprise or self-serve?` |

---

## Ready for Real Work?

When you want to use your own organizational context:

```
/clear-demo     → Removes all demo content
```

Demo content is clearly marked with `[DEMO DATA]` tags.

---

## Quick Reference

| Task | Command |
|------|---------|
| Create a PRD | `/prd [topic]` |
| Document a decision | `/decision-record [topic]` |
| Capture feedback | `/feedback-capture` |
| Check portfolio | `/portfolio-status` |
| Get PM perspective | `@pm [question]` |
| Leadership meeting | `@plt [question]` |

## Instructions

1. Ask user to confirm their working directory is correct
2. Create each folder using mkdir (Bash tool)
3. Create each file using Write tool (only if doesn't exist)
4. Report what was created
5. Skip files that already exist (don't overwrite)
