name: setup
description: Initialize the Product Org plugin - creates context folders and index files
argument-hint: (no arguments needed)
---

Initialize the **Product Org Plugin** for first-time use. This creates the context folder structure and all necessary index files in your current working directory.

## V2V Phase

**Cross-phase** - Setup is a prerequisite for all V2V work. Run once per project.

**Prerequisites**: None (this is the starting point)
**Outputs used by**: All skills that use the context layer

## What Gets Created

```

├── README.md               # How to use the context layer
├── decisions/

└── feedback/

    └── themes.md           # Recurring patterns
```

## When to Run

Run `/setup` once when you first install the plugin in a new project. The skill is idempotent - it won't overwrite existing files.

## Process

### 1. Check Current Directory

Confirm the user's working directory is where they want the context layer created.

### 2. Create Directory Structure

Create all required folders:
- `context/`
- `context/decisions/`
- `context/bets/`
- `context/assumptions/`
- `context/portfolio/`
- `context/learnings/`
- `context/handoffs/`
- `context/feedback/`

### 3. Create Index Files

Create each index file with its initial template (only if it doesn't already exist):

#### context/README.md
```markdown
# Context Layer

The Context Layer provides **persistent memory** for your AI product organization. It enables decisions to be remembered, agents to share context, and the organization to learn from outcomes.

## Quick Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/context-save` | Save decision, bet, or learning |
| `/context-recall [topic]` | Query past decisions/context |
| `/portfolio-status` | View current strategic bets |
| `/handoff` | Capture context for delegation |
| `/relevant-learnings [topic]` | Find applicable past learnings |
| `/feedback-capture` | Capture and analyze feedback |
| `/feedback-recall [topic]` | Query past feedback |

## Folder Structure

- `decisions/` - Decision records with rationale
- `bets/` - Strategic bets with assumptions
- `assumptions/` - Tracked assumptions for validation
- `portfolio/` - Current active portfolio state
- `learnings/` - Accumulated organizational wisdom
- `handoffs/` - Agent-to-agent context passing
- `feedback/` - Customer and market feedback

## How It Works

1. After decisions/bets: `/context-save` extracts to registry
2. Before new work: `/context-recall` finds related context
3. For delegation: `/handoff` briefs receiving agent
4. For feedback: `/feedback-capture` documents with analysis
5. After outcomes: Reviews update assumptions and extract learnings

## Instructions

1. Ask user to confirm their working directory is correct
2. Create each folder using mkdir (Bash tool)
3. Create each file using Write tool (only if doesn't exist)
4. Report what was created
5. Skip files that already exist (don't overwrite)
