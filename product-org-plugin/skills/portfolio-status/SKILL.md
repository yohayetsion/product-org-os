View the **current state** of the strategic portfolio — all active bets, their health, and upcoming checkpoints.

## V2V Phase

**Cross-phase** - This skill provides portfolio context for any strategic work.

**Prerequisites**: Strategic bets created and tracked
**Outputs used by**: All phases (ensures alignment with portfolio strategy)

## Purpose

Provides a dashboard view of what the organization is currently betting on, enabling strategic alignment and informed prioritization.

## When to Use

Invoke `/portfolio-status` when:
- Starting a strategic planning session
- Before making portfolio tradeoff decisions
- Checking alignment of new work with current bets
- Reviewing upcoming re-decision checkpoints
- PLT needs an overview of current strategic state

## Process

### 1. Read Portfolio State

Read `context/portfolio/active-bets.md` to get current portfolio.

### 2. Read Related Context

For each active bet, also check:
- `context/assumptions/registry.md` — Status of key assumptions
- `context/bets/index.md` — Full bet details if needed

### 3. Generate Status Report

```markdown
# Portfolio Status

*As of: [Current Date]*

## Executive Summary

| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Active Bets | [N] |
| Proposed (Awaiting Approval) | [N] |
| At Risk (Yellow/Red) | [N] |
| Checkpoints This Month | [N] |
| Assumptions Pending Validation | [N] |

## Active Strategic Bets

### [SB-ID]: [Bet Title]
- **Owner**: @[agent/person]
- **Status**: Active
- **Health**: [Green/Yellow/Red] [emoji indicator]
- **Started**: [Date]
- **Next Checkpoint**: [Date] — [Type: Early signal / Mid-point / End]
- **Key Assumptions**:
  - [A-NNN]: [Assumption] — [Status]
  - [A-NNN]: [Assumption] — [Status]
- **Notes**: [Current status/blockers]

[Repeat for each active bet]

## Proposed Bets (Awaiting Approval)

| ID | Title | Owner | Proposed Date | Blocker |
|----|-------|-------|---------------|---------|
| [ID] | [Title] | @[owner] | [Date] | [What's needed] |

## Upcoming Checkpoints

| Date | Bet | Checkpoint | Decision Options |
|------|-----|------------|------------------|
| [Date] | [ID]: [Title] | [Type] | Continue / Pivot / Stop |

## At-Risk Assumptions

Assumptions that are pending validation and may affect active bets:

| Assumption ID | Assumption | Affects Bet | Due Date | Risk Level |
|---------------|------------|-------------|----------|------------|
| [A-NNN] | [Text] | [SB-ID] | [Date] | High/Med/Low |

## Dependencies

| Bet | Depends On | Status |
|-----|------------|--------|
| [ID] | [What it depends on] | [Blocked/On track] |

## Recommendations

Based on current portfolio state:
- [Recommendation 1]
- [Recommendation 2]
```

### 4. Highlight Actions Needed

Call out anything that needs attention:
- Overdue checkpoints
- At-risk bets (Yellow/Red)
- Invalidated assumptions affecting active bets
- Blocked dependencies

## Instructions

1. Read `context/portfolio/active-bets.md`
2. Read `context/assumptions/registry.md`
3. Read `context/bets/index.md` for additional details
4. Generate the status report following the format above
5. Calculate summary metrics
6. Highlight items needing attention
7. Provide actionable recommendations

## Health Indicators

Use these criteria for bet health:

| Health | Criteria |
|--------|----------|
| Green | On track, assumptions holding, no blockers |
| Yellow | Minor concerns, assumption at risk, or approaching checkpoint |
| Red | Blocked, key assumption invalidated, or significantly off track |

## Output

Present the status report in a clear, scannable format. Offer to:
- Drill into any specific bet
- Create a presentation version with `/present`
- Update the portfolio with new information
