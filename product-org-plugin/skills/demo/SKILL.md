# Demo (Alias for Tour)

This is an alias for `/tour`. Both commands run the same interactive walkthrough.

## Behavior

When invoked, immediately run the tour skill content. Present the same 5-step walkthrough:

1. **Agent + File** - Delegating work with context
2. **@product Gateway** - Routing to the right agents
3. **Context Layer** - Institutional memory
4. **Direct Skills** - Power user mode
5. **V2V Framework** - Where work fits

## Instructions

Follow the exact same process as `/tour` - read and execute the tour skill instructions from the tour skill in this plugin.

## Why This Alias Exists

Some users instinctively type `/demo` when exploring a new system. This alias ensures they find the walkthrough regardless of which term they use.
