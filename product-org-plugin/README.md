## Quick Start

```bash
# Install in Claude Code
claude plugins install github:yohayetsion/product-org-os

# Initialize in your project
/setup

# Start using
@product Launch freemium tier for SMBs. Context: @pricing-research.md
```

## Two Invocation Patterns

| Syntax | Purpose | Example |
|--------|---------|---------|
| `@agent` | **Delegate** - spawn autonomous agent | `@pm create a PRD for auth` |
| `/skill` | **Inline** - use template/workflow directly | `/prd` `/decision-record` |

### @product Gateway
Your single entry point. Routes requests to the right agents automatically.
```
@product Launch freemium for SMBs. Context: @pricing-research.md
@product Q2 planning. Inputs: @customer-interviews/ @eng-capacity.md
```

**Response Depth** (`+`/`-` modifiers):
| Modifier | Effect | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `-` | Brief - executive summary | `@product What's launch status? -` |
| *(none)* | Standard - balanced depth | `@product What's launch status?` |
| `+` | Deep - full analysis | `@product What's launch status? +` |

**Meeting Mode**: When you use `@product` or `@plt`, you'll see responses from *individual agents* speaking in their own voice - like walking into a meeting room. You'll see who's engaged, their perspectives, agreements, and tensions. This isn't a monolithic AI response - it's your product org thinking together.

**Multi-Product Organizations**: Filter context by product:
```
/context-recall pricing product:AXIA
/feedback-recall onboarding product:SKYMOD
/portfolio-status product:AXIA
```

### Delegate to Agents (`@agent`)
Spawn autonomous agents to handle tasks. Each agent reasons independently and returns results.
```
@cpo review @board-feedback.pdf and update strategic intent
@pm break down @epic.md into user stories
@plt review @portfolio-health.md - should we pivot?
@bizops analyze @pricing-data.xlsx and create pricing model
```

**Agent Shortcuts:**
| Shortcut | Full Agent | Domain |
|----------|------------|--------|
| `@pm` | `@product-manager` | PRDs, specs, user stories |
| `@plt` | `@product-leadership-team` | Portfolio decisions |
| `@pm-dir` | `@director-product-management` | Roadmap governance |
| `@pmm-dir` | `@director-product-marketing` | GTM strategy |
| `@pmm` | `@product-marketing-manager` | Campaigns, enablement |
| `@ci` | `@competitive-intelligence` | Market analysis |
| `@prod-ops` | `@product-operations` | Launch, process |

### Use Skills Directly (`/skill`)
Create, update, or find specific deliverables inline.
```
Create a /prd for SSO integration - see @slack-thread.md
Run /competitive-analysis on Acme - @their-demo-notes.md
Update the /roadmap-theme for Growth with mobile initiatives
Find all authentication PRDs using /prd find
```

### Mix Both Patterns
Combine agents and skills naturally.
```
@pm-dir review @launch-data.xlsx and update the /gtm-strategy
@cpo review @board-feedback.pdf and update /strategic-intent
@vp-product review @sales-feedback.md and run /pricing-strategy
```
