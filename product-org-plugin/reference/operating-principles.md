# V2V Operating Principles

The 8 Operating Principles for World-Class Product Organizations.

## 1. End-to-End Ownership

**Principle**: Product organization is accountable from strategy through outcomes.

**What it means**:
- Own the full value chain, not just the "product" part
- Accountability extends from strategic intent to customer value realization
- No handoffs without ownership transfer

**In practice**:
- Track outcomes, not just outputs
- Stay involved through launch and adoption
- Own success metrics end-to-end

**Enforcement Skill**: `/ownership-map` - Maps accountability across V2V phases
**When to use**: Before major commitments (Phase 2→3 transition)

## 2. Decision Quality

**Principle**: Decision quality is the core metric for product leadership effectiveness.

**What it means**:
- Good process leads to better outcomes over time
- Quality decisions need single owners, clear criteria, and re-decision triggers
- Speed matters, but not at the expense of quality

**In practice**:
- Use decision records for important decisions
- Create decision charters for recurring decisions
- Audit decision quality periodically

## 3. Customer Obsession

**Principle**: Every decision should trace to customer value.

**What it means**:
- Customer problems, not internal convenience, drive priorities
- Evidence-based understanding of customer needs
- Value is what customers experience, not what we ship

**In practice**:
- Start with customer problem in every document
- Include customer evidence and quotes
- Measure customer outcomes, not just adoption

**Enforcement Skill**: `/customer-value-trace` - Validates decisions trace to customer value
**When to use**: When making decisions that affect customers

## 4. Strategic Clarity

**Principle**: Clear bets with explicit assumptions.

**What it means**:
- Strategy is about choices - make them explicit
- Assumptions should be documented and testable
- Acknowledge opportunity costs

**In practice**:
- Use strategic bet framework
- Document and number assumptions
- Define what would prove you wrong

## 5. Outcome Focus

**Principle**: Success is measured by results, not outputs.

**What it means**:
- Shipping is not success - outcomes are success
- Leading indicators matter, but lagging indicators prove it
- Learn from both wins and misses

**In practice**:
- Define success criteria before starting
- Conduct outcome reviews after launches
- Feed learnings back into decisions

## 6. Collaborative Excellence

**Principle**: Right people, right inputs, right time.

**What it means**:
- Cross-functional collaboration is a feature, not a bug
- Input doesn't mean consensus - decisions need owners
- Involve stakeholders early, not at the end

**In practice**:
- Use RACI for accountability clarity
- Gather input before decisions are made
- Communicate decisions to affected parties

**Enforcement Skill**: `/collaboration-check` - Validates RACI and stakeholder consultation
**When to use**: For cross-functional work and major decisions

## 7. Continuous Learning

**Principle**: Systematic capture and application of learnings.

**What it means**:
- Learning is a process, not an accident
- Mistakes are valuable if we learn from them
- Knowledge should be accessible and applied

**In practice**:
- Conduct retrospectives regularly
- Document learnings in searchable form
- Update processes based on learnings

## 8. Scalable Systems

**Principle**: Processes that work as the organization grows.

**What it means**:
- Design for growth, not just current state
- Processes should enable, not constrain
- Match complexity to maturity level

**In practice**:
- Review and optimize processes periodically
- Don't over-engineer for current size
- Invest in tooling that scales

**Enforcement Skill**: `/scale-check` - Assesses scalability at 2x, 10x, 100x
**When to use**: Before committing resources to solutions
