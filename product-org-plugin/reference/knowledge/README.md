# Domain Knowledge Packs

Professional PM frameworks and methodologies that agents reference when producing deliverables. These complement the V2V operating system — V2V defines WHEN and HOW to work, knowledge packs define WHAT tools and frameworks to use within that process.

## Usage

Agents reference these packs automatically when their task calls for framework selection or methodology guidance. You can also read them directly as professional reference material.

## Relationship to V2V

Knowledge packs INFORM agent work within the V2V framework:
- **V2V** says "do a competitive analysis in Phase 1" (the WHEN)
- **Knowledge packs** say "use Porter's Five Forces when analyzing industry structure" (the WHAT)
- **Agent persona** says "I'm the CI analyst, I focus on actionable competitive intelligence" (the WHO)

These layers are independent. Changing a knowledge pack doesn't affect V2V process rules or agent personalities.
