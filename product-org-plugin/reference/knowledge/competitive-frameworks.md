# Competitive Frameworks & Methods

## Overview

Competitive analysis informs strategic choices about positioning, pricing, timing, and differentiation. This pack covers frameworks for industry analysis, competitor profiling, competitive selling, and strategic response. Reference this when producing competitive landscapes, battlecards, positioning strategies, or any deliverable that requires understanding the competitive environment.

## Frameworks

### Porter's Five Forces

**When to use**: When you need to analyze the overall attractiveness and competitive dynamics of an industry, not just individual competitors.

**How it works**: Michael Porter's framework analyzes five forces that shape industry profitability and competitive intensity:

1. **Threat of New Entrants**: How easy is it for new companies to enter this market? High barriers (capital, regulation, network effects, switching costs) protect incumbents. Low barriers invite disruption.

2. **Bargaining Power of Suppliers**: How much leverage do your suppliers have? If there are few suppliers of a critical input (e.g., a specific API, a rare skill set), they can extract value.

3. **Bargaining Power of Buyers**: How much leverage do your customers have? Consolidated buyer base, low switching costs, or commodity products increase buyer power.

4. **Threat of Substitutes**: What alternatives exist outside your direct market? (e.g., spreadsheets as a substitute for project management software, or "do nothing" as a substitute for any product.)

5. **Competitive Rivalry**: How intense is competition among existing players? Many competitors, slow growth, high fixed costs, and low differentiation increase rivalry.

**Template**:

| Force | Intensity (Low/Med/High) | Key Factors | Strategic Implication |
|-------|-------------------------|-------------|----------------------|
| New Entrants | | | |
| Supplier Power | | | |
| Buyer Power | | | |
| Substitutes | | | |
| Rivalry | | | |
| **Overall Industry Attractiveness** | | | |

**Analysis guidance**:
- Score each force as Low, Medium, or High
- For each force, list 2-3 specific factors driving the score
- Derive one strategic implication from each force
- The combination reveals where to focus strategy

**Limitations**: Static snapshot -- does not capture industry dynamics or disruption. Best combined with trend analysis. Can be done at too high a level to be actionable.

### SWOT Analysis

**When to use**: When you need a structured overview of internal capabilities and external dynamics, particularly for strategic planning sessions.

**How it works**: SWOT maps four quadrants:
- **Strengths**: Internal capabilities and assets that give you advantage
- **Weaknesses**: Internal gaps or limitations that hinder you
- **Opportunities**: External trends or changes you could exploit
- **Threats**: External forces that could harm your position

The real value comes from the **SWOT Action Matrix** -- crossing internal factors with external factors to generate strategies:

| | Opportunities | Threats |
|---|---|---|
| **Strengths** | **SO Strategies**: Use strengths to capture opportunities | **ST Strategies**: Use strengths to mitigate threats |
| **Weaknesses** | **WO Strategies**: Improve weaknesses to capture opportunities | **WT Strategies**: Minimize weaknesses to avoid threats |

**Template**:

| Strengths | Weaknesses |
|-----------|------------|
| 1. | 1. |
| 2. | 2. |
| 3. | 3. |

| Opportunities | Threats |
|---------------|---------|
| 1. | 1. |
| 2. | 2. |
| 3. | 3. |

**Derived Strategies**:

| Strategy Type | Strategy | Priority |
|---------------|----------|----------|
| SO (leverage) | | |
| ST (defend) | | |
| WO (improve) | | |
| WT (avoid) | | |

**Limitations**: Often done superficially. "Strengths" and "Weaknesses" are relative to competitors, not absolute. Without the action matrix, SWOT is just a list.

### Competitive Battlecards

**When to use**: When sales teams need structured, actionable competitive information to win deals against specific competitors.

**How it works**: A battlecard is a concise (1-2 page) competitive reference document designed for sales use during active deals. It must be current, practical, and focused on winning, not just informing.

**Structure of an effective battlecard**:

**Section 1: Quick Overview**
- Competitor name, logo, positioning statement
- Key metrics: company size, funding, customer count (if known), pricing
- One-line positioning: "They position as [X], we position as [Y]"

**Section 2: How They Win / How They Lose**
- Their top 3 strengths (be honest -- sales loses trust if you dismiss competitors)
- Their top 3 weaknesses (specific and verifiable, not vague)
- Deals they tend to win: [segment, use case, buying criteria]
- Deals they tend to lose: [segment, use case, criteria where they fall short]

**Section 3: Objection Handling**
| Objection | Response | Proof Point |
|-----------|----------|-------------|
| "Competitor X has feature Y" | [Acknowledge, differentiate, redirect] | [Customer quote, data point] |
| "Competitor X is cheaper" | [Reframe on value, not price] | [TCO analysis, ROI data] |
| "Competitor X has more customers" | [Quality over quantity, segment focus] | [Reference customer in their segment] |

**Section 4: Win Themes**
- Top 3 reasons customers choose us over this competitor
- Key questions to ask prospects that expose competitor weaknesses (without being negative)
- Discovery questions that favor our strengths

**Section 5: Land Mines**
- Topics to avoid that play to competitor strengths
- Pricing comparison pitfalls
- Feature comparison traps

**Template**: See structure above. Key principle: every statement should be something a salesperson can say confidently in a customer meeting.

**Limitations**: Requires regular updates (quarterly minimum). Must be based on evidence, not opinion. Overly negative battlecards erode sales trust. Must be tested with sales to ensure they actually use them.

### Win/Loss Analysis

**When to use**: When you need to understand why you win and lose deals to improve product, positioning, and sales approach.

**How it works**: Win/loss analysis involves structured post-deal interviews with prospects (won and lost) to understand their decision-making process.

**Interview methodology**:
- Conduct interviews within 2-4 weeks of the decision (memory fades)
- Interview the economic buyer or primary evaluator, not just your champion
- Use a third party if possible (prospects are more honest with neutral interviewers)
- Interview both wins and losses (wins reveal what to protect; losses reveal what to fix)

**Interview guide**:
1. What triggered the evaluation? (Business need / event)
2. What criteria were most important in your decision?
3. Which solutions did you evaluate? (Competitive set)
4. What were the top 2-3 factors in your final decision?
5. Was there anything that almost changed your decision?
6. How did you perceive [our product] vs. [competitor]?
7. What could we have done differently?

**Coding scheme for analysis**:

| Category | Codes |
|----------|-------|
| Decision factors | Price, Features, Ease of use, Integration, Support, Trust, Brand |
| Competitor mentioned | [Specific competitor names] |
| Win/Loss driver | Product superiority, Price, Relationship, Timing, Risk perception |
| Segment | Enterprise, Mid-market, SMB |

**Reporting template**:

| Metric | This Quarter | Last Quarter | Trend |
|--------|-------------|-------------|-------|
| Win rate (overall) | X% | Y% | Up/Down |
| Win rate vs. Competitor A | X% | Y% | |
| Win rate vs. Competitor B | X% | Y% | |
| Top win reason | [Reason] | [Reason] | |
| Top loss reason | [Reason] | [Reason] | |
| Avg deal size (won) | $X | $Y | |
| Avg deal size (lost) | $X | $Y | |

**Limitations**: Prospects may not be fully honest. Small sample sizes can be misleading. Requires consistent process to generate patterns. Interviewer skill matters significantly.

### Competitive Positioning Maps

**When to use**: When you need to visualize market positioning and identify white space or crowded segments.

**How it works**: A positioning map plots competitors on a 2x2 matrix using two dimensions that matter to buyers. The choice of axes is the most important decision -- they should represent the dimensions along which customers actually differentiate between products.

**How to choose dimensions**:
1. List the criteria buyers use to evaluate products (from win/loss, surveys, or sales input)
2. Select two dimensions that (a) differentiate competitors and (b) matter to your target segment
3. Avoid correlated dimensions (e.g., "features" and "complexity" tend to move together)

**Common dimension pairs**:
- Ease of use vs. Feature depth
- Price vs. Capability
- Vertical focus vs. Horizontal breadth
- Self-serve vs. Enterprise-led
- Innovation speed vs. Stability/reliability

**Template**:

```
                  HIGH [Dimension 2]
                       |
                       |   Competitor C
                       |
    Competitor A       |           Competitor B
                       |
   -------- LOW [Dim 1]|------------- HIGH [Dim 1] -------
                       |
                       |        [White Space?]
            Us         |
                       |
                  LOW [Dimension 2]
```

**Strategic implications**:
- Clusters indicate crowded segments (high rivalry)
- Empty quadrants may represent white space (opportunity) or unviable positions (dead zone)
- Your desired position should be defensible and valued by your target segment
- Movement vectors show where competitors are heading

**Limitations**: Two dimensions cannot capture all competitive dynamics. The map is a simplification. Different buyer segments may value different dimensions.

### Competitive Response Framework

**When to use**: When a competitor makes a move (price change, feature launch, acquisition) and you need to decide how to respond.

**How it works**: Not every competitive move requires a response. The framework evaluates the threat level and selects an appropriate response type.

**Threat assessment**:

| Factor | Score (1-5) |
|--------|-------------|
| Impact on our target segment | |
| Speed of customer switching | |
| Visibility to our customers | |
| Competitor's execution capability | |
| Alignment with competitive trend | |
| **Total Threat Score** | /25 |

**Response types**:

| Response | When to Use | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Ignore** | Threat score < 8. Competitor move targets different segment or is poorly executed | Niche competitor launches feature for a segment you do not serve |
| **Monitor** | Threat score 8-14. Worth watching but no immediate action needed | Competitor announces a feature on their roadmap (not shipped yet) |
| **Defend** | Threat score 15-19. Protect existing position with messaging, enablement, or accelerated roadmap | Competitor undercuts pricing -- respond with value messaging and ROI tools |
| **Attack** | Threat score 20-25. Competitive move exposes their weakness or creates an opening | Competitor acquisition creates integration uncertainty -- run competitive displacement campaign |
| **Leapfrog** | Any score. Use competitive move as catalyst for innovation beyond the competitor | Competitor launches feature X -- you skip X and build the category-defining version |

**Response planning template**:

| Element | Detail |
|---------|--------|
| Competitive move | [What the competitor did] |
| Threat score | [X/25] |
| Response type | [Ignore/Monitor/Defend/Attack/Leapfrog] |
| Actions | [Specific steps] |
| Owner | [Single accountable person] |
| Timeline | [When to execute] |
| Success measure | [How we know the response worked] |

**Limitations**: Threat scores are subjective. Over-responding to competitors can distract from your own strategy. Under-responding to real threats can cost market share. Balance is key.
