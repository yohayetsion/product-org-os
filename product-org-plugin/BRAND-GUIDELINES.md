## Brand Essence

### Vision
"The Operating System for World-Class Product Organizations"

### Positioning Statement
For VP/Director-level product leaders at growth-stage companies who are drowning in chaos and struggling to scale their product organization, Product Org OS is an AI-powered organizational operating system that transforms heroic individual effort into systematic, repeatable excellence. Unlike ChatGPT or generic AI copilots that just help individuals work faster, Product Org OS understands your entire product org - its structure, decisions, history, and institutional knowledge - functioning as your org chart, not just your assistant.

### Core Differentiators
1. **Organizational Memory** - Context that persists across sessions and agents
2. **Multi-Agent Orchestration** - 13 role-based agents that think like your team
3. **Decision Quality Framework** - Structured decision-making built in
4. **V2V Methodology** - Intent to Outcomes in 6 systematic phases

### Brand Pillars
- **From Heroic to Systematic** - End the dependence on individual heroics
- **Built for the Whole Org** - Not a personal assistant, an organizational system
- **AI That Understands Product Org Context** - Institutional knowledge, not just prompts

---

## Visual Identity Philosophy

### Dark Mode First

Product Org OS embraces a **dark-mode dominant aesthetic** that reflects:

- **Technical Credibility** - Aligns with developer and power-user preferences
- **Terminal Heritage** - Evokes the CLI/terminal environment where the product lives
- **Executive Gravitas** - Dark interfaces signal sophistication and premium quality
- **Reduced Eye Strain** - Practical for product leaders who spend long hours on screens

### The Tech-Premium Balance

Our visual language bridges two worlds:
- **Technical Precision** - Clean lines, monospace typography, terminal aesthetics
- **Executive Premium** - Refined gradients, generous spacing, sophisticated color relationships

This isn't a developer tool pretending to be enterprise. It's a premium product that respects its technical roots.

## Logo Concepts

### Primary Logo: "The Gradient Wordmark"

**Visual Description:**
The Product Org OS wordmark uses a horizontal gradient from Vibrant Red (`#E94560`) to Emerald Teal (`#4ECCA3`), creating a distinctive signature that works beautifully on dark backgrounds.

**Styling:**
- **"Product Org"** - Gradient from Red to Teal
- **"OS"** - Gold accent color (`#FFC93C`) or matching gradient
- **Typography**: Inter Bold (700 weight)
- **Letter-spacing**: +2% for clarity

**Variations:**
1. **Full Gradient Mark**: Complete wordmark with gradient treatment
2. **Solid Light**: Single-color `#EAEAEA` for dark backgrounds where gradient isn't feasible
3. **Solid Dark**: Single-color `#1A1A2E` for rare light-background uses
4. **Icon Only**: Stylized hexagon mark for favicons and app icons

### Secondary Logo: "The Convergence Hexagon"

**Visual Description:**
A stylized hexagon formed by six interconnected nodes, representing the six V2V phases. Rendered with gradient strokes that transition from Red to Teal. The nodes glow subtly against dark backgrounds.

**Symbolism:**
- **Hexagon shape**: Stability, efficiency, systematic thinking
- **Six nodes**: The V2V phases (Intent > Decisions > Commitments > Execution > Outcomes > Learning)
- **Connecting lines**: Agents and skills working in harmony
- **Gradient treatment**: Dynamic progression, transformation

**Construction Notes:**
- Nodes should have subtle glow/bloom effect on dark backgrounds
- Lines at 60% opacity of gradient
- Use `box-shadow` or SVG filters for the glow effect
- Hexagon rotated 30 degrees (flat edge at bottom for stability)

### Wordmark Typography

**"Product Org OS"** specifications:
- **Typeface**: Inter Bold (700 weight)
- **Gradient**: Linear from `#E94560` to `#4ECCA3` (left to right)
- **Letter-spacing**: +2%
- **Effect**: Subtle text-shadow for depth on dark backgrounds

**Tagline Treatment:**
"The Operating System for World-Class Product Organizations"
- Set in Inter Regular or Medium
- Light gray (`#EAEAEA`) or 70% opacity white
- 40-50% size of wordmark
- 1x cap-height spacing below wordmark

## Typography

### Primary Typeface: Inter

A modern, highly legible sans-serif designed for screens. Chosen for:
- Excellent readability at all sizes
- Professional yet approachable tone
- Strong support for technical content
- Works beautifully in both light and dark modes

**Weights:**
- **Inter Regular (400)** - Body text, descriptions
- **Inter Medium (500)** - Subheadings, emphasized content
- **Inter SemiBold (600)** - Section headers, navigation
- **Inter Bold (700)** - Headlines, wordmark, key CTAs

### Monospace Typeface: SF Mono / Fira Code

For code examples, terminal output, agent/skill references.
- SF Mono (preferred on Apple platforms)
- Fira Code (cross-platform fallback)
- Reinforces the terminal/CLI aesthetic

**Use for:**
- `/skill-name` references
- `@agent` invocations
- Code snippets
- Terminal-style UI elements

### Type Scale (Dark Mode Optimized)

| Level | Size | Weight | Line Height | Color |
|-------|------|--------|-------------|-------|
| Display | 48-72px | Bold | 1.1 | `#EAEAEA` or gradient |
| H1 | 36-42px | Bold | 1.2 | `#EAEAEA` |
| H2 | 28-32px | SemiBold | 1.25 | `#EAEAEA` |
| H3 | 22-24px | SemiBold | 1.3 | `#EAEAEA` |
| H4 | 18-20px | Medium | 1.4 | `#EAEAEA` |
| Body | 16-18px | Regular | 1.6 | `#EAEAEA` |
| Small | 14px | Regular | 1.5 | `#A0A0A0` |
| Micro | 12px | Medium | 1.4 | `#A0A0A0` |
| Code | 14-16px | Mono | 1.5 | `#4ECCA3` |

### Typography Guidelines

- **Headlines**: Title case, never all caps, consider gradient treatment for hero headlines
- **Body**: Sentence case, `#EAEAEA` on dark backgrounds
- **Agent names**: Capitalize (Product Manager, not product manager)
- **Skill names**: Monospace, Teal color (`#4ECCA3`), lowercase with slash (`/prd`)
- **Gateway invocations**: Monospace, Teal color, with @ (`@product`, `@plt`)

---

## Visual Language & Design Principles

### 1. Dark Canvas, Bright Actions

The dark background creates a canvas where important elements pop. Use the primary colors (red, teal, gold) sparingly for maximum impact.

**Do:**
- Use vibrant colors for CTAs, links, and key information
- Let dark space breathe - don't fill every corner
- Create depth through subtle background color variations

**Don't:**
- Overuse bright colors - they lose impact
- Use pure black (#000000) - it's too harsh
- Create low-contrast text that strains eyes

### 2. Terminal Aesthetic, Executive Polish

Reference the CLI/terminal world but elevate it for executive audiences.

**Visual Devices:**
- Monospace type for technical elements
- Subtle border-radius (4-8px) - not too rounded, not too sharp
- Glassmorphism effects: `backdrop-filter: blur(10px)`
- Subtle glow effects on interactive elements

**Examples:**
```css
/* Card with glassmorphism */
.card {
  background: rgba(22, 33, 62, 0.8);
  backdrop-filter: blur(10px);
  border: 1px solid rgba(78, 204, 163, 0.2);
  border-radius: 8px;
}

/* Glowing button */
.button-primary {
  background: #E94560;
  box-shadow: 0 0 20px rgba(233, 69, 96, 0.4);
}
```

### 3. Depth Through Layers

Create visual hierarchy using background variations and subtle shadows.

**Background Hierarchy:**
1. **Page background**: `#1A1A2E`
2. **Elevated cards**: `#16213E`
3. **Modal overlays**: `#16213E` with border
4. **Highlighted elements**: Subtle gradient or glow

### 4. Connected Systems

Show relationships and data flow - reflecting the organizational memory and agent orchestration.

**Visual Devices:**
- Connecting lines with gradient strokes
- Flow diagrams for V2V phases
- Node-and-edge visualizations with glow effects
- Animated transitions that suggest data flowing

### 5. Confident Authority

For senior product leaders - confident, sophisticated, substantive.

**Visual Devices:**
- Generous whitespace (or rather, "dark space")
- Large, confident typography
- Restrained color usage
- Data visualizations that show depth

## Glassmorphism & Effects

### Card Treatment

```css
.glass-card {
  background: rgba(22, 33, 62, 0.6);
  backdrop-filter: blur(12px);
  -webkit-backdrop-filter: blur(12px);
  border: 1px solid rgba(78, 204, 163, 0.15);
  border-radius: 12px;
  box-shadow: 0 8px 32px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.3);
}
```

### Glow Effects

```css
/* Primary button glow */
.glow-red {
  box-shadow: 0 0 20px rgba(233, 69, 96, 0.4);
}

/* Success/teal glow */
.glow-teal {
  box-shadow: 0 0 20px rgba(78, 204, 163, 0.4);
}

/* Gold accent glow */
.glow-gold {
  box-shadow: 0 0 20px rgba(255, 201, 60, 0.4);
}
```

### Gradient Overlays

```css
/* Subtle gradient overlay for sections */
.gradient-overlay {
  background: linear-gradient(
    180deg,
    rgba(26, 26, 46, 0) 0%,
    rgba(15, 52, 96, 0.3) 100%
  );
}
```

## Iconography

### Style Guidelines

- **Line weight**: 1.5-2px stroke
- **Color**: Light gray (`#EAEAEA`) default, Teal (`#4ECCA3`) for active/selected
- **Style**: Outlined, not filled (except for state indicators)
- **Glow**: Subtle glow on hover/active states
- **Size**: Design on 24x24 grid

### Core Icon Set

| Concept | Icon Description | Color Treatment |
|---------|------------------|-----------------|
| Agents | User silhouette with network node | Light gray, teal on active |
| Skills | Document with checkmark | Light gray, teal on active |
| Context | Brain with circular halo | Violet (`#805AD5`) |
| Decisions | Branching path | Gold (`#FFC93C`) |
| Gateway | Entry portal / doorway | Primary gradient |
| Learning | Circular arrow / loop | Rose red |
| Phase | Hexagon segment | Phase-specific color |

### Agent Icons

Each agent role has a visual differentiator with consistent style:

| Agent | Visual Element | Icon Color |
|-------|----------------|------------|
| CPO | Crown/star | Gold |
| VP Product | Upward trend chart | Teal |

### Emoji Mapping for CLI

In terminal/CLI contexts where custom icons cannot render, use these official emoji equivalents. These provide quick visual identification while maintaining brand alignment with the icon concepts above.

| Agent | Emoji | Rationale |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| CPO | 👑 | Crown represents executive authority |
| VP Product | 📈 | Upward chart reflects strategic growth focus |
| Director PM | 📊 | Bar chart represents delivery metrics & roadmap governance |
| Director PMM | 📣 | Megaphone for GTM and market communication |
| Product Manager | 📄 | Document represents specs and requirements |
| PMM | 🎯 | Target for campaigns and customer focus |
| BizOps | 🧮 | Abacus for financial analysis and metrics |
| BizDev | 🤝 | Handshake for partnerships |
| Competitive Intel | 📡 | Radar/satellite for market monitoring |
| Product Ops | ⚙️ | Gear for process and tooling |
| Value Realization | 💲 | Dollar for ROI and customer outcomes |
| UX Lead | ✏️ | Pencil for design work |
| PLT | 👥 | Group for leadership team collective |
| Product Gateway | 🏢 | Building represents the org entry point |

**Usage in CLI responses:**
```
### 📈 VP Product:
"From a strategic perspective..."

### 📊 Director PM:
"On the delivery side..."
```

These emojis are used in:
- Agent response headers in Meeting Mode
- Multi-agent synthesis presentations
- Task assignments and handoffs

## Light Mode Considerations

While dark mode is primary, light mode may be needed for:
- Print materials
- Documentation contexts where users expect light
- Accessibility requirements

**Light Mode Adjustments:**
- Background: `#F5F7FA` (soft gray-white)
- Card background: `#FFFFFF`
- Primary text: `#1A1A2E`
- Keep primary colors (Red, Teal) unchanged
- Remove glow effects (they don't work on light)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Logo Finalization**: Create final vector assets with gradient treatment
2. **Icon Library**: Develop Figma component library for all icons
3. **Component Library**: Build CSS/React components implementing these specs
4. **Motion Guidelines**: Define animation principles (transitions, micro-interactions)
5. **Template Creation**: Website, presentation, documentation templates
