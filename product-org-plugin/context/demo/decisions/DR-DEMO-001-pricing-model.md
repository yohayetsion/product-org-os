## Context

We need to decide on a pricing model for our enterprise tier launch in Q1 2026. Current freemium model has 15% conversion but average deal size is low.

## Options Considered

1. **Seat-based pricing** - $49/seat/month
2. **Usage-based pricing** - Tiered by API calls
3. **Hybrid model** - Base platform fee + per-seat for advanced features

## Decision

**Selected: Option 3 - Hybrid model**

Rationale:
- Provides predictable revenue for us (base fee)
- Scales with customer value (per-seat)
- Competitive with Competitor X's model
- Allows entry at lower price point

## Success Criteria

- Average deal size increases by 40% within 6 months
- Enterprise conversion rate maintained at 15%+
- Customer feedback on pricing clarity is positive (NPS 7+)

## Re-decision Triggers

- If average deal size doesn't increase by 20% in 3 months
- If we lose 3+ deals citing pricing complexity
- If Competitor X significantly undercuts our pricing

## Assumptions

- A-DEMO-001: Enterprises value predictability over pure usage-based pricing
- A-DEMO-002: Our feature set justifies premium over competitors
- A-DEMO-003: Sales team can effectively explain hybrid model
