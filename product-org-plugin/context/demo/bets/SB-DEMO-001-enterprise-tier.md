## The Bet

We believe that launching a dedicated enterprise tier with advanced security, SSO, and premium support will capture the large organization market segment and increase ARPU by 3x.

## Customer Insight

Enterprise prospects consistently cite three gaps in our current offering:
- No SSO/SAML support
- No SLA guarantees
- No dedicated support channel

## Market Dynamics

- Enterprise SaaS market growing 18% YoY
- 70% of enterprise buyers require SSO as table stakes
- Competitors X and Y have enterprise tiers at $199 and $249/seat
- Gap in market for "enterprise-lite" offering

## Business Intent

- Capture 50 enterprise accounts in first 6 months
- Increase ARPU from $15/user to $49/user for enterprise segment
- Establish platform for future enterprise expansion (audit logs, compliance)
