## The Bet

We believe that investing in a friction-free self-serve onboarding experience will increase conversion from free to paid by 50% and reduce customer acquisition cost by 40%.

## Customer Insight

User research shows:
- 65% of trial users abandon during first 10 minutes
- Top friction points: account setup (40%), first workflow (35%), unclear value prop (25%)
- Users who complete "first win" within 5 minutes convert at 3x rate

## Market Dynamics

- PLG (Product-Led Growth) is standard expectation in B2B SaaS
- Competitors with strong self-serve have 2x faster growth
- SMB segment (our largest) expects zero-touch purchasing
- CAC for self-serve is typically 60% lower than sales-assisted

## Business Intent

- Increase trial-to-paid conversion from 8% to 12%
- Reduce time-to-value from 45 minutes to 10 minutes
- Enable SMB segment growth without proportional sales scaling
- Build foundation for product-qualified lead (PQL) model

## Explicit Assumptions

| ID | Assumption | Confidence | Validation Method |
|----|------------|------------|-------------------|
| A-DEMO-014 | Users can complete core workflow without human help | Medium | Usability testing |
| A-DEMO-015 | Improved onboarding drives conversion, not just activation | Medium | Cohort analysis |
| A-DEMO-016 | We can identify "first win" moment for our product | High | User journey analysis |
| A-DEMO-017 | Self-serve users have similar LTV to sales-assisted | Low | 6-month cohort tracking |

## Success Criteria

| Metric | Target | Timeline |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Trial-to-paid conversion | 12% (from 8%) | 3 months |
| Time to first value | < 10 minutes | 3 months |
| Self-serve revenue % | 30% (from 15%) | 6 months |
| CAC payback period | < 6 months | 6 months |

## Checkpoints

| Date | Checkpoint | Re-decision Criteria |
|------|------------|---------------------|
| 2026-02-01 | MVP launch | Activation rate < 50% → Revisit UX |
| 2026-04-01 | 90-day review | Conversion < 10% → Evaluate approach |
| 2026-07-01 | 6-month review | Self-serve revenue < 25% → Consider hybrid |

## Resource Commitment

- Engineering: 2 FTE for 4 months
- Design: 1 FTE for 2 months
- Product: 50% of PM capacity
