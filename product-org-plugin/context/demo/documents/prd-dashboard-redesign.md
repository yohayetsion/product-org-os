## Problem Statement

Our current dashboard shows too much information at once, leading to decision paralysis. User research indicates 70% of users only interact with 3 of the 12 dashboard widgets.

## Customer Insight

> "I open the dashboard every morning and immediately feel overwhelmed. I just want to know if there's anything I need to act on today."

## Goals

1. Reduce cognitive load on dashboard
2. Surface actionable items prominently
3. Allow personalization for power users
4. Maintain access to detailed analytics

## Success Criteria

| Metric | Current | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| Dashboard engagement | 45% | 70% |
| Time to first action | 3.5 min | < 1 min |
| User satisfaction (dashboard) | 6.2/10 | 8/10 |

## Solution

### Core Concept: "Action-First Dashboard"

1. **Today's Actions** - Top of page, maximum 5 items
2. **Key Metrics** - 3 user-selectable KPIs
3. **Activity Feed** - Collapsed by default
4. **Deep Dive** - Link to detailed analytics
