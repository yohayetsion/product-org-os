## How Assumptions Flow

1. **Created**: When a `/strategic-bet` or `/decision-record` includes explicit assumptions
2. **Extracted**: `/context-save` pulls assumptions into this registry
3. **Tracked**: Each assumption has a validation method and timeline
4. **Validated**: `/outcome-review` updates status based on real data
5. **Surfaced**: Invalidated assumptions trigger re-decision alerts

## Assumption ID Format

`A-[NNN]` where NNN is a sequential number across all assumptions.
