## How Themes Are Identified

1. **Automatic tagging**: `/feedback-capture` assigns topics to each entry
2. **Pattern detection**: When 3+ feedback entries share the same topic, a theme is suggested
3. **Manual elevation**: Agents can elevate important patterns to themes
4. **Theme review**: During retrospectives, themes should be reviewed and updated
