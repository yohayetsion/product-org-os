# Strategy Document Rules

When working with strategy documents in `strategy/`, `bets/`, or `plans/` folders:

## Required Elements

Every strategy document MUST have:

1. **Explicit Assumptions**
   - What we believe to be true
   - How we'll validate each assumption
   - Impact if assumption is wrong

2. **Opportunity Cost**
   - What we're NOT doing
   - Why this choice over alternatives
   - Trade-offs acknowledged

3. **GTM Consideration**
   - How will this get to market?
   - Who will sell/support it?
   - Early GTM input incorporated

4. **Success Definition**
   - Clear outcomes expected
   - Measurable metrics
   - Timeline for evaluation

## Strategic Bet Quality

For strategic bets specifically:

- [ ] Customer insight is evidence-based
- [ ] Market dynamics support the timing
- [ ] Business intent is clear
- [ ] Assumptions are numbered and testable
- [ ] Re-decision points are scheduled

## V2V Operating Principle

> "Strategic clarity means clear bets with explicit assumptions."

Strategy is about choices. Make choices explicit, document assumptions, and plan for learning.
