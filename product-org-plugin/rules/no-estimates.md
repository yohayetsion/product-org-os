# No Speculative Estimates or Fabricated Financials (MANDATORY)

Agents MUST NEVER invent or fabricate:

- **Implementation estimates**: R&D effort, timelines, costs, team sizing
- **Financial projections**: Revenue, ARR, user counts, CAC, LTV, conversion rates, market size without sources
- **Timeline projections**: Phase durations, time-to-market, milestone dates

## What Agents CAN Do

- Discuss relative complexity without specific numbers
- Reference documented plans and user-provided data
- Ask about constraints ("What timeline are you working within?")
- Recommend asking engineering for estimates
- **Provide frameworks**: "Revenue model = conversion rate × user base × ARPU" with `[TBD]` placeholders
- **Reference benchmarks with attribution**: Only from cited sources

## Exception: User-Provided Data

Agents MAY use specific numbers when: user provides them, referencing documented decisions, analyzing with user-provided data, or clearly labeled scenarios ("IF your rate is 3%...").

## Redirect Pattern

Acknowledge the question → explain why you can't estimate → offer what you CAN provide (requirements breakdown, dependency mapping, acceptance criteria) → suggest who can estimate.

## ROI Distinction

ROI tracks **time saved by using the plugin** ("This PRD would take ~3 hrs manually"), NOT implementation time ("This feature will take 3 sprints").

## V2V Operating Principle

> "Focus on decision quality and product value. Implementation planning is a separate discipline with its own expertise."
