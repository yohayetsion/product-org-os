# V2V Operating System Flow

The Vision to Value (V2V) Operating System defines how product work flows from strategic intent to customer outcomes. This rule documents the complete flow with skill mapping for each phase.

## The Six Phases

```
+-------------------+     +---------------------+     +----------------------+
| PHASE 1:          |     | PHASE 2:            |     | PHASE 3:             |
| STRATEGIC         |---->| STRATEGIC           |---->| STRATEGIC            |
| FOUNDATION        |     | DECISIONS           |     | COMMITMENTS          |
| (Input Phase)     |     | (Commercial Filter) |     | (Point of No Return) |
+-------------------+     +---------------------+     +----------------------+
                                                               |
+-------------------+     +---------------------+               v

## Phase Transition Guidelines

### Phase 1 → Phase 2
**Trigger**: Strategic foundation complete
**Validation**: Can articulate target market, competitive position, and vision

### Phase 2 → Phase 3
**Trigger**: Commercial decisions made
**Validation**: Business case approved, pricing defined, key assumptions documented
**CRITICAL**: This is the "Commercial Filter" - not all initiatives pass

### Phase 3 → Phase 4
**Trigger**: Commitments locked
**Validation**: Run `/commitment-check` to verify readiness
**CRITICAL**: This is the "Point of No Return" - resources committed

### Phase 4 → Phase 5
**Trigger**: Product launched
**Validation**: GTM executing, customers can access product

### Phase 5 → Phase 6
**Trigger**: Outcomes measurable
**Validation**: Sufficient time/data to evaluate success criteria

### Phase 6 → Phase 1
**Trigger**: Learning cycle complete
**Validation**: Insights documented, fed back into strategic planning

---

## Using This Flow

### Check Current Phase
Run `/phase-check [initiative]` to assess:
- Which phase an initiative is in
- What deliverables are complete
- What gaps exist
- What's needed to progress

### Ensure Prerequisites
Before starting Phase N work, verify Phase N-1 is complete. The system enforces this through `/commitment-check` at critical junctures.

### Track Progress
Update `context/portfolio/active-bets.md` with phase tracking:
| Bet ID | Name | Current Phase | P1 | P2 | P3 | P4 | P5 | Status |

## V2V Operating Principle

> "The V2V flow is not bureaucracy - it's a thinking framework that ensures we do the right things in the right order. Skip phases at your peril."
