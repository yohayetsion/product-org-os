# V2V Operating System Flow

The Vision to Value (V2V) Operating System defines how product work flows from strategic intent to customer outcomes.

**Flow**: Phase 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 → (feeds back to Phase 1)

---

## The Six Phases

| Phase | Name | Purpose | Key Skills | Exit Criteria |
|-------|------|---------|------------|---------------|
| **1** | Strategic Foundation | Establish strategic context and market understanding | `/strategic-intent`, `/market-analysis`, `/competitive-landscape`, `/vision-statement`, `/market-segment` | Clear where-to-play and why |
| **2** | Strategic Decisions | Critical business decisions for commercial viability | `/business-case`, `/pricing-strategy`, `/positioning-statement`, `/decision-record`, `/strategic-bet` | Viability validated, decisions documented |
| **3** | Strategic Commitments | Convert decisions into executable commitments | `/product-roadmap`, `/gtm-strategy`, `/launch-plan`, `/prd`, `/feature-spec`, `/user-story`, `/commitment-check` | Organization aligned, resources committed |
| **4** | Coordinated Execution | Execute plan with cross-functional coordination | `/campaign-brief`, `/sales-enablement`, `/launch-readiness`, `/stakeholder-brief` | Product launched, GTM executing |
| **5** | Business & Customer Outcomes | Realize promised value and track outcomes | `/onboarding-playbook`, `/value-realization-report`, `/customer-health-scorecard` | Outcomes measurable, success evaluable |
| **6** | Learning & Adaptation | Extract learnings, validate assumptions, feed back | `/outcome-review`, `/retrospective`, `/decision-quality-audit`, `/context-save`, `/feedback-capture` | Learning loop complete |

### Cross-Phase Skills

`/context-recall`, `/feedback-recall`, `/interaction-recall`, `/portfolio-status`, `/portfolio-tradeoff`, `/handoff`, `/present`, `/qbr-deck`, `/maturity-check`, `/pm-level-check`, `/phase-check`

### Principle Validators

| Skill | Principle | When |
|-------|-----------|------|
| `/ownership-map` | #1 End-to-End Ownership | Before commitments |
| `/customer-value-trace` | #3 Customer Obsession | Before decisions |
| `/collaboration-check` | #6 Collaborative Excellence | Cross-functional work |
| `/scale-check` | #8 Scalable Systems | Process/system design |

## Phase Transitions

| Transition | Trigger | CRITICAL |
|------------|---------|----------|
| 1→2 | Strategic foundation complete; can articulate target market and vision | |
| 2→3 | Commercial decisions made; business case approved, pricing defined | **Commercial Filter** — not all pass |
| 3→4 | Commitments locked; run `/commitment-check` | **Point of No Return** — resources committed |
| 4→5 | Product launched; customers can access | |
| 5→6 | Outcomes measurable; sufficient data for evaluation | |
| 6→1 | Learning cycle complete; insights fed back | |

Before Phase N work, verify Phase N-1 is complete. Track progress in `context/portfolio/active-bets.md`.

## Document Intelligence

Documents evolve across phases. Skills support **Create/Update/Find** modes:
- Same initiative, later phase → **UPDATE**
- New initiative → **CREATE**
- Significant pivot → New document with link to predecessor

## V2V Operating Principle

> "The V2V flow is not bureaucracy - it's a thinking framework that ensures we do the right things in the right order. Skip phases at your peril."
