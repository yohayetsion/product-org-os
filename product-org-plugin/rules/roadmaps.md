# Roadmap Rules

When working with roadmap documents:

## Required Elements

Every roadmap MUST have:

1. **Vision Alignment**
   - Clear connection to product vision
   - How themes support strategic goals
   - Link to strategic bets

2. **Theme-Based Organization**
   - Organized by strategic themes, not features
   - Each theme has clear rationale
   - Success metrics per theme

3. **Prioritization Rationale**
   - Why items are prioritized as shown
   - Criteria used for prioritization
   - Trade-offs acknowledged

4. **Confidence Levels**
   - Now: High confidence
   - Next: Medium confidence
   - Later: Low confidence (directional)

## Roadmap Quality Checks

- [ ] Themes connect to strategic goals
- [ ] Each initiative has an owner
- [ ] Dependencies are mapped
- [ ] Success metrics are defined
- [ ] Resource requirements are realistic
- [ ] Risks are identified

## 6-Step Roadmapping Process

1. Gather inputs (market, customers, strategy)
2. Define themes
3. Prioritize themes
4. Sequence initiatives
5. Validate capacity
6. Communicate

## V2V Operating Principle

> "Roadmap themes should connect to strategic bets."

A roadmap is not a list of features. It's a plan for executing strategy through themes that deliver customer and business value.
