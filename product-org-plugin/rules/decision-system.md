# Decision System Rules

When working with decision documents in `decisions/` or `charters/` folders:

## Required Elements

Every decision document MUST have:

1. **Single Accountable Owner**
   - One person who can say yes/no
   - Role and name specified
   - Not a committee or "team"

2. **Success Criteria**
   - Measurable outcomes
   - Specific targets
   - Timeframes defined

3. **Re-decision Triggers**
   - Evidence that would reopen the decision
   - Specific and observable
   - Assigned owner to monitor

## Quality Checks

Before finalizing any decision document, verify:

- [ ] Owner is identified (single person)
- [ ] Options were considered (at least 2-3)
- [ ] Rationale is documented
- [ ] Success criteria are measurable
- [ ] Re-decision triggers are specific
- [ ] Contributors are acknowledged

## Decision Record Format

Use the `/decision-record` skill template for individual decisions.
Use the `/decision-charter` skill template for recurring decision types.

## V2V Operating Principle
