# GTM Document Rules

When working with go-to-market documents in `gtm/`, `launch/`, or `marketing/` folders:

## Required Elements

Every GTM document MUST have:

1. **GTM as Strategic Choice**
   - GTM approach is deliberate, not default
   - Market entry strategy justified
   - Sales motion matches customer buying behavior

2. **Positioning Before Launch**
   - Positioning defined early
   - Messaging framework complete
   - Competitive differentiation clear

3. **Success Criteria**
   - Measurable launch metrics
   - Awareness, adoption, revenue targets
   - Timeframes for evaluation

4. **Cross-functional Alignment**
   - Product-marketing-sales aligned
   - Support readiness addressed
   - Customer success prepared

## GTM Quality Checks

- [ ] Target customer clearly defined
- [ ] Positioning is differentiated
- [ ] Pricing is justified
- [ ] Sales motion is defined
- [ ] Launch timeline is realistic
- [ ] Success metrics are measurable

## 11-Step GTM Process

1. Define market opportunity
2. Identify target customers
3. Develop positioning
4. Create messaging
5. Set pricing
6. Define sales motion
7. Plan marketing activities
8. Enable sales team
9. Prepare support
10. Execute launch
11. Measure and iterate

## V2V Operating Principle

> "GTM is a strategic choice, not just execution. Positioning should happen early, not at launch."

Don't treat GTM as an afterthought. The how-to-market decision is as important as the what-to-build decision.
