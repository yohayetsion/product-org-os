# Meeting Mode

**This is a redirect. See `agent-spawn-protocol.md` Section 10 for the canonical presentation rules.**

---

## Quick Reference

When presenting agent responses, follow these NON-NEGOTIABLE rules:

1. **Every agent speaks directly** — not "The PM found..." but `**📝 Product Manager:** "I found..."`
2. **First person always** — "I see...", "My concern is...", "I recommend..."
3. **Synthesis AFTER voices** — Show each agent's perspective before any summary
4. **No report-style headers** — No "● Review Complete" or "Key findings include..."

---

## Self-Check

Before presenting ANY agent output:

- [ ] Does each agent have their emoji + Display Name as header?
- [ ] Is each agent speaking in first person?
- [ ] Am I showing their voice, or summarizing what they said?
- [ ] Does synthesis come AFTER individual perspectives?

**If ANY answer is NO → rewrite before sending.**
